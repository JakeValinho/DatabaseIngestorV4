Join us for one of Kogod’s premier events.
You will have the opportunity to network with business leaders and colleagues from your school and others. The event is open to all graduate and undergraduate students at American University and invited Kogod-partner schools.
Overview
Case
competitions focus on a challenge or opportunity faced by an organization. Participants work together in teams to recommend solutions to the leadership of that organization. There are different formats and styles for case competitions, but they often come with cash prizes (see below for more information about Kogod's prizes). Additionally, competitors build their resumes and network with employers.
Eligibility
All undergraduate and graduate (including WCL) students at AU as well as partner schools of Kogod are invited to compete in teams of 3-5 students. There are two competition divisions: Undergraduate and Graduate. Having two divisions ensures that students are competing against others who have had similar experiences or coursework.
Format
There are two rounds in the competition: The first round is
online
only
. Teams will receive the case study and then have approximately one week to submit a video pitch with their proposed recommendations. Video submissions are reviewed by judges and scored for the preliminary round.
The top seven teams in each division are then invited to Kogod in mid-February to present their full recommendations in a 15-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute Q&A before a panel of judges. Our judges are mostly alumni and area business leaders, many of whom have been judging the Competition for several years.

General Guidelines
Release of the Case
The case will be released on
Friday, November 1 at 5pm ET.
Research and Outside Experts
Once the case is posted, coaching by faculty members or school staff or contact with outside experts is expressly prohibited. Teams are expected to conduct any and all necessary research through publicly available resources. Use of all library resources, including pay-for-subscription services such as Lexis-Nexis, is welcomed.
Students
MAY NOT
gain assistance in any form from anyone other than the Center for Professionalism and Communications or comparable business communications/preparation office at other institutions. Prohibited assistance includes but is not limited to faculty sponsors, professors, parents, friends, or personal contacts of any kind whose ideas are not publicly available (i.e., published online).
For AU students, the Business Librarian may help you conduct research but not answer any questions about the case content or possible solutions. Comparable library staff and resources are allowed at partner schools as well.
Each team is permitted to have presentation practice with the Center for Professionalism and Communications or comparable business communications/preparation office at other institutions, prior to the competition. Feedback in these sessions with the team will be restricted to clarity, organization, format, and style. Feedback on content or strategy is not permitted.
Your team will be disqualified from the competition if you violate these rules.
Tiebreakers
In case of a tie in either round, judges will be asked to rank each team. The team with the highest rankings will win the tie. If there is still a tie, three judges will be selected at random by the scoring official. The team that has garnered the highest scores from these randomly selected judges will win the tie.
Guidelines for The Preliminary Round
Each team will submit a video pitch which may include visual aids.
The purpose of the pitch is to provide judges with an idea of the approach your team will take to address the issues presented in the case. Remember, a case competition poses a problem that needs a solution. You might not know what your final recommendations will be, but your pitch will give preliminary round judges a sense of what critical analysis your team has undertaken. This analysis could include ideas, people, and data that are central to your proposed solutions and why your ideas will lead to strong recommendations for the company.
All team members must speak and be visible in the pitch video.
The length of the video will be no longer than 5 minutes.
Videos longer than 5 minutes will be disqualified; no exceptions.
Scoring
The preliminary round scoring structure is:
Critical Issues: 10 points
Recommendations: 10 points
Delivery/Professionalism: 10 points
Overall Impression: 10 points
The maximum total score is 40 points.
Final Round Information

One of the benefits of being a finalist is sharing your resume with all judges. AU team members must submit a resume via the Case Comp Canvas site and partner school team members must submit a resume to
kogodcasecomp@american.edu
. The deadline for inclusion is the first Friday in February at 5pm.

All presentations must be saved in Microsoft PowerPoint format. (Note: Presentations will be viewed on computers with Microsoft 365.)

The presentation file should be the only item on the USB.
Sound effects are NOT allowed in the presentation.
Graphics ARE allowed but animation effects are discouraged.
To achieve the best presentation quality, the screen should be set to wide aspect (1366 x 768).
In the case of technical difficulties, each team is allowed to bring printouts of their slide show to give to judges if the laptop or projection fails (plan for 10 judges, i.e., bring 10 copies of the presentation and at least one for the team.) You may also bring a backup copy of your presentation on a USB drive in case the file on the drive malfunctions. Ten minutes will be allotted to fix any technical or equipment problems after which the teams must use their handouts.

All team members must speak during the presentation.
Notecards are allowed to be used during the presentation.

FAQs
BACK TO TOP ↵
Who can be on my team?
There are two divisions of teams:
Undergraduate:
Team is comprised of undergraduate students; no graduate students are allowed on this team.
Graduate:
Team is comprised of graduate students; no undergraduate students are allowed on this team.
The purpose of this is to group participants with similar skill levels so division judges can fairly compare teams during the finals.
What happens if we want to add or remove team members?
We permit (up to) five-person teams to promote a balanced distribution of the work that goes into creating a presentation for the Case Competition. Teams with fewer people will have more work to do individually than a team with more people.
Why is there a GPA requirement?
Participating in the competition requires a significant amount of time and energy. We have determined that students who are on academic probation will not benefit from the competition in the same way as those students who are in good academic standing. Undergraduate students whose GPA is below a 2.5 and graduate students whose GPA is below a 3.0 should focus on their coursework to improve their GPAs and look forward to competing next year.
Can I register as a free agent and then move to a team later?
Absolutely. We recommend registering yourself as soon as possible to save a space. Of course, if you have a team formed, you should all register as soon as possible, but if you find teammates later, you can add them to your team. If you register as a free agent and would like to be added to a team later, just email
kogodcasecomp@american.edu
. Unfortunately, you can't save spots for team members and we cannot "complete" partial teams after the case has been released, so don't delay!
Can I still participate if I'm not a Kogod student? Can I include students from other AU schools on my team?
Yes. The Kogod Case Competition has value for all students at American University. The event is open to all graduate and undergraduate students at AU. Students from all academic backgrounds and levels of experience will enjoy and benefit from the event. We have had all schools represented by competitors in the past and hope to do the same this year! The cases that students analyze encompass communications, nonprofit management, public policy, and law, in addition to business.
What support is available to help prepare for the competition?
Kogod provides several resources to help AU students be prepared for the competition. First, the Case Competition Canvas site will be your "one-stop" for case competition resources, including videos of past finalists and updates from staff. For non-AU teams, this information will be shared via email.
I'm a first-year/sophomore...do I have the business knowledge I need to participate?
Yes! A big part of the competition is working on a team and learning how to analyze a business case from any level of experience. As a first-year/sophomore, you will gain experience in how to manage your time during a competition and how to work on a team so that in future years, you will be able to focus more on the application of your business knowledge. In addition, the opportunity to network with judges could land you your next internship and give you a solid experience to highlight during an interview. Finally, the opportunity to interact and network with upper division Kogod students could help you make new friends and get connected with the Kogod student community.
How can I highlight the case competition on my resume?
The Kogod Case Competition is
a great addition
to your resume as well as integral to your interview prep.
Career Development
staff
members are
prepared to help you highlight this experience to fit the jobs/internships you are looking for. We hear
ti
me and time again
t
hat students have landed a job or internship because of the skills they
ac
quired
d
uring the competition and/or the network they cultivated during the event.
What time commitment is required to participate?
You probably hear this saying a lot but "you will get out of the competition what you put into it." Remember, the case competition is not required, but you are working on a team with peers who are committed to giving the case competition their best shot. So, you need to pull your weight. The case competition isn't an excuse for missing class, so make sure you plan accordingly and prepare class assignments and readings in advance to ease the workload that week.
How is the competition scored and how are teams ranked?
Each presentation will be observed and scored by a panel of judges who are business leaders and alumni. It is important to remember that this competition is different than classroom grading. Judges are not faculty and they will each come to the competition with a background of experiences that will, inevitably, inform their scoring. In preparation, we send each judge the case in advance and provide a training session led by Kogod faculty and Kogod Center for Professionalism and Communications. We hope students will embrace the opportunity to be in front of a real panel of professionals and appreciate the diverse experiences brought by each of our judges.
Why are partner schools invited to send a team to the Kogod Case Competition?
The Kogod School of Business values:
its globally diverse student body and faculty
partnerships with the people and institutions shaping international change
educating its students to be competitive in the US and abroad
offering exchange and study abroad opportunities
educating students and institutions around the world about the Kogod School of Business
Benefits of inviting partner schools to the Kogod Case Competition include:
providing AU students the opportunity to see how business students from other schools conduct case analysis
giving AU students experience competing in a global marketplace
demonstrating Kogod's value to a wider audience
strengthening the relationships between Kogod and its partners

Objective
Case Competitions focus on an issue faced by an organization and participants work together to recommend solutions to leadership in that organization. There are different formats and styles for competitions but they often come with cash prizes (see the Prizes and Awards section below for more information about Kogod's prizes). Additionally, competitors build their resumes and network with employers.
Description
Who:
All undergraduate and graduate (including WCL) students at AU as well as partner schools of Kogod are invited to compete in teams of 2-5 students. There are three competition divisions: First-year/Sophomore, Junior/Senior, and Graduate. The three divisions ensure that students are competing against others who have had similar experiences or coursework. Our judges are mostly alumni and area business leaders, many of whom have been judging the Competition for more than five years!
What:
There are two rounds in the competition: The first round is online only where teams will receive the case study then submit a video pitch with their proposed recommendations. This video is reviewed by judges and scored. The top five teams in each division are then invited to Kogod in early February to present their full recommendations in a 10 to 15-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute Q&A before a panel of judges.
Where:
Online (preliminary round) and on the American University campus (final round)
Registration opens in September, workshops on case analysis are hosted in October for AU competitors, the case is released in late October, the digital preliminary submission process occurs in late-October and early-November, and the in-person final round for the top 5 teams in each division occurs in early-February
Why:
- Network with employers - Meet alumni and business leaders and provide them with your resume
- Build your resume - Case Competition participation will impress.
- Improve case analysis skills - You'll need them to succeed in school and beyond.
- Increase your Market Value - Next time you have an assignment for class or work, you'll have added skills and experience.

With Fierce Work Ethic, Business Students Take First Place in American University Case Challenge
The case competition involved integrating artificial intelligence into Xylem Inc., an American water technology provider and Fortune 500 company, that does business in more than 150 countries.
Five second-year business students took first place in the Kogod Case Competition at American University earlier this month. Pictured from left are:
 Maria Cayward, Kabir Ramnani, Daniel Barbieri, David Lu and Sophia Viar.
A fierce work ethic, great research, and many hours of practice helped the UConn Case Club win the top prize at the 32nd Kogod Case Competition at American University earlier this month.
This is the second consecutive year that the UConn team took home the top prize. A new team competed this year, and all five participants are second-year business students who had never entered a case competition before.
“Our ideas were super niche and I think that took the judges by surprise,’’ said Sophia Viar, a finance major and the president of the club. “They were intrigued by the complexity of what we had done.’’
The team prepared for months, sometimes putting in five hours a day to fine-tune their case and improve their presentation.
“We practiced over and over in the School of Business Board Room,’’ Viar said. “We basically asked each other questions over and over. We drilled. We were ready for every question that the judges threw at us.’’
Other team members included: Maria Cayward (analytics and information management), David Lu (finance), Kabir Ramnani (finance) and Daniel Barberi (finance and economics). None of the team members knew each other well before they started the competition.
The Challenge: Using AI to Help a Fortune 500 Company
The case competition involved integrating artificial intelligence into Xylem Inc., an American water technology provider and Fortune 500 company, that does business in more than 150 countries.
In their final presentation, the Husky team proposed using Novable software, which sources startups that match a company’s needs. They also recommended exploring the offerings of Oxyle, a company with a new filter that can destroy PFAS contaminants.
“One of the judges, who works for Xylem, said, ‘You hit the nail on the head. You guys are amazing!’ ’’ Viar said. The UConn team defeated four teams from American University, as well as teams from the University of Pennsylvania and Boston University. They also took the prize for Best Q&A when the competition concluded on Feb. 15 in Washington, DC.
The victory reflects the enormous effort that the team put into the project.
“We started working on the case in November and there was a lot of back and forth with the team,’’ Viar said. “We had four months to develop our idea, and we changed direction often. It was pretty rocky in the first months until we nailed it down.’’
Ramnani said the team had incredible spirit and dedication, despite some mumbling about having to work over the holiday break.
“All of us had a hunger for it. We wanted to put our best foot forward,’’ Ramnani said. “I think one of the key lessons I learned is how to articulate ideas in a concise way. If you over-speak, you overcompensate. What matters is the quality of what you say. I learned to make my answers concise and deliberate.’’
Competition Will Enhance Careers Down the Road
Viar is planning a career in management consulting and said the competition is well aligned with her career aspirations. She looks forward to discussing her case-competition achievement in job interviews.
Ramnani agreed, saying the competition highlighted the problem-solving skills of every team member.
“I really didn’t know anything about the water industry until I started working on the case competition. I had to learn so much,’’ he said. “I also learned that sometimes you have to cut your losses. If we worked on an idea for a week and it wasn’t working out, I learned not to be emotionally attached to the idea, to move on and try something new.’’

Multidisciplinary Student Team Wins First Place in American University Case Competition, Showcases the ‘Exceptional Talent’ at UConn
The championship team participated in the 31st Annual
Kogod Case Competition
at American, a three-month challenge that concluded in mid-February.

A strong, collaborative team, impressive strategic insights, and an amazing presentation all contributed to a multidisciplinary UConn student team taking first place in a recent case competition at American University.
“One judge told us it was the best presentation she had seen in her 20 years of judging,’’ said
Tyler Martin
’25, an economics and political science major, and part of the
Husky Case Competition Club
.
The championship team participated in the 31st Annual
Kogod Case Competition
at American, a three-month challenge that concluded in mid-February. The winning team also included
Adam Skarre
’25 (mechanical engineering),
Tara Sperry
’26 (marketing)
Matthew Conroy
’25 (finance) and
Shane Markle
’25 (finance).
The case competition was organized by Lightility, an energy company, and focused on electric-vehicle infrastructure. The challenge involved marketing, scaling strategies, and financial projections. The UConn team competed against the University of Pennsylvania, Boston University, Indiana University, Loyola University and George Washington University.
“As the faculty advisor and mentor for the club, it has been a privilege to witness their dedication firsthand,’’ said management professor
Sami Ghaddar
. “The credit for this victory undeniably belongs to the students, whose strategic insight and hard work truly set them apart.’’
“Our students’ victory in the junior/senior division is a testament to the quality of education and experiential learning at the UConn, showcasing the exceptional talent we nurture,’’ he said.
Varied Academic Backgrounds Proved Helpful

Martin and Markle both said they enjoyed the challenge of solving a real-world issue.
“I thoroughly enjoyed developing a strong understanding of a unique, innovative, and timely industry,’’ Martin said. “The electric-vehicle industry is constantly changing, and developing expertise in an industry rooted in sustainability was particularly interesting,’’ Martin said. “I didn’t find devoting three months to the project difficult, considering there was so much to understand and gain foundational knowledge on. Throughout the three months, our understanding of the case in its entirety shifted many times.’’
Markle agreed that the case was intriguing.
“It allowed me to learn about business beyond the classroom and delve into all the moving parts behind decision making,” Markle said. “Devoting three months to this project was time-consuming, but I don’t think I could have asked for a better team to work with, which made the process very enjoyable.”
Skarre said the team’s varied academic backgrounds, from business, engineering and liberal arts, proved valuable.
“This diversity allowed us to leverage each other’s strengths, fostering both individual creativity and collaborative synergy,’’ Skarre said. “By combining our different perspectives, we maintained a holistic approach throughout our work.’’
Sperry said the staff and students at AU were welcoming and the team had a great time networking with them along with the judges, Lightility’s directors, and other competitors.
“This experience has enhanced my communication and teamwork skills,’’ Sperry said, adding that the experience will make her a better professional.
“Our team communicated, supported, and respected each other’s ideas and opinions which contributed to our success,’’ she said.
‘I Never Gave Thought to the Other Competitors’
“I think the biggest lesson that this experience has taught me is how to get out of my comfort zone. It was my first case competition so I didn’t know what to expect, but with the support of our team, we were able to succeed,’’ Markle said. “Learning how to take that leap out of my comfort zone and try something new is a skill I will definitely be able to use in my future endeavors.”’
Martin said the case competition enhanced his leadership, time management, problem-solving and team work skills.
Although it was a great deal of work, Conroy said his team made it enjoyable.
“My favorite part was honestly spending time with my groupmates,’’ he said. “Spending three months on a project with people I enjoyed being around made the process enjoyable, even when it was stressful at times.’’
Martin said he and the team never really focused on the competition.
“To be completely honest, I never gave thought to the other competitors. To me, case competitions are about working with your team to create the best possible end-product. The reality is you cannot control how other teams perform,’’ he said. “We just made sure we showed up finalist weekend with a product we were proud of. We are beyond proud to positively represent UConn and bring the trophy home to Storrs!’’
“As thrilling as taking home this award is, it is more than just winning, it’s about showcasing UConn’s caliber on a national level and reinforcing our status as a ‘Public Ivy,’ ” Skarre said. “UConn being No. 1 should be expected in all arenas.’’
