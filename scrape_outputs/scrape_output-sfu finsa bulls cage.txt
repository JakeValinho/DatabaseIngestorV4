Thrilled to announce that my team and I have won the 2025 Bull‚Äôs Cage Stock Pitch Competition, hosted by SFU Finance Student Association (FINSA)! üèÜ We pitched Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR), emphasizing its cost leadership through advanced drilling efficiencies, accretive synergies from its Ameredev acquisition, and favorable macro tailwinds in the oil sector. With limited time to prepare, we focused on refining our valuation models and delivering a structured, well-supported presentation. Big thanks to my teammates Adam Bilodeau, Joel Elsaesser, and Bao Minh Nguyen for their great collaboration, dedication, and hard work throughout the competition. Also, a huge shoutout to FINSA for organizing such a fantastic event and to all judges for their valuable feedback. Pictures courtesy of SFU Finance Student Association‚Äîappreciate them capturing these great moments! This experience was a great test of adaptability and quick thinking under pressure. Excited for what‚Äôs next!

Daniel Roddick will be speaking on the panel "Liquidity in Private Credit: Secondary Market Trading and Secondary Funds" next week at the third annual Private Credit Industry Conference in Florida, hosted by LSTA and DealCatalyst. The discussion will be moderated by Adelene Lee from Reorg, with Daniel joining fellow panellists Michael Loehrke from Golub Capital, Tikehau Capital's Tim Grell, Anthony Diaz from Antares Capital LP, and LSTA's Theodore Basta. We‚Äôll unpack the growing demand for liquidity, the need for a dedicated secondary trading desk for private capital, and the role secondaries funds can play in investors‚Äô portfolios. The discussion will also explore the pressure from third-party regulators on fair valuations and transparency, and the push and pull between investment liquidity compared to transactional trading. We're excited to be part of this timely conversation and share our insights as a specialist advisor in the secondaries space. Drop us a line if you're also attending, we'd love to say hello! #directlending #middlemarketfinance #privateequity #privatecredit #secondaries #panel

As the Private Credit Secondary Market continues to grow, it becomes more important to be discerning about what you are buying as not all secondaries will generate the same returns. We expect the biggest transactions to be the most competitive as the large asset managers seek to deploy assets, but not necessarily with the goal of generating the highest returns. Corbin Capital Partners, L.P. 's focus continues to be on the less crowded market segments, where we expect larger discounts to persist for longer.
Corbin Capital Partners, L.P. has long been active in the private credit secondaries market, completing our first transaction 20 years ago. Our Partner and Deputy CIO ‚Äì Credit, John Cocke, recently spoke with Bloomberg‚Äôs Kat Hidalgo about his experience underwriting both managers and underlying individual assets and key considerations as the private credit secondaries market sees a flurry of recent mega-deals. He explained that ‚ÄúEveryone wants a piece of these big deals,‚Äù yet discounts have narrowed as more entrants flood the market, and ‚Äúit may be an auction winner‚Äôs curse.‚Äù Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/gVguqQ8d
