Frequently Asked Questions
Is there a fee to register?
No, there is no fee to register.
Will there be prizes?
Prizes will be awarded to the winning team. Details will be provided on the day of the event.
Can student teams receive any help on addressing the case?
Before the case is released, faculty advisors may help prepare students for the competition. However, once the case is released, faculty advisors may only be able to provide minimal assistance. Faculty advisors should not provide input on strategy or how to approach the case or provide specific solutions; they can help clarify conceptual questions that are not case-specific. Faculty, students, or other interested parties may not offer suggestions or revisions to case content prepared by the teams. Only official team members can work on the case.
Teams may not contact any Loma Linda University Health employees, its affiliates, or the entity the case is addressing.
What are the required deliverables?
Each team is required to submit a PowerPoint presentation with references and appendices along with a 1-2 page Executive Summary of the Presentation.
How long is the presentation and is there a slide # limit?
The presentation should take no more than 15 minutes. While there is no specified slide limit, keep in mind the main deck of slides should be able to be presented during the allotted time frame. Presentations may have Appendices which can be referred to during the Q&A. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions after the presentation for up to 10 minutes. Teams may reference appendix slides in the presentation during the Q&A. During the presentation, a timekeeper will signal the 5-minute mark and 1-minute mark to conclude the presentation. Teams are not allowed to surpass the time limit.
What if the teams have questions after the case is released?
The Loma Linda University School of Public Health’s Healthcare Administration Program and Loma Linda University Health will hold a brief (Zoom) conference shortly after the case is released to answer any clarifying questions from participants. Questions should be emailed in advance of the call to
hshah@llu.edu
.
Are teams allowed to modify their slide deck before the on-site presentation?
No modifications can be made once the deck has been submitted.
May program directors and faculty attend the on-site presentations?
Faculty advisers/Program Directors may attend the presentations but if they attend the presentations of other Schools, they will not be able to meet with their team members until after their team has presented.
Will teams presenting be de-identified?
Team deliverables will be sent directly to a dropbox folder or email. During the competition, the judges will not know the names of the Schools the teams are representing, however, once the winner is announced, we will present the participating teams and their respective Schools.
What is needed on the day of competition?
Each team member should have a computer with a microphone, video camera, Internet access and Zoom application.
