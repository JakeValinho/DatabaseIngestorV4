We just grabbed your attention ‚Äî precisely what a good social asset should do. Now that we‚Äôve got you, let‚Äôs dive in! For the fourth year running, we‚Äôve taken on the two-day Social Media workshop for the new class at JvM Academy in Hamburg - Raika Schmid (she/her), Jan Schmechtig (he/him), and Sascha Wieland had the best time with 19 bright students from all over Europe üá™üá∫ Here are a few golden rules they shared: ü§ù ùó™ùóºùóøùó∏ ùòÅùóºùó¥ùó≤ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóø, ùóπùó≤ùóÆùóøùóª ùòÅùóºùó¥ùó≤ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóø, ùó¥ùóøùóºùòÑ ùòÅùóºùó¥ùó≤ùòÅùóµùó≤ùóø: Involve all relevant stakeholders. Strategy, Creatives, Social, Production, Media ‚Äî it‚Äôs all about integration and cross-education. üß† ùó¶ùòÅùóøùóÆùòÅùó≤ùó¥ùòÜ ùó≥ùó∂ùóøùòÄùòÅ, ùóÆùóπùòÑùóÆùòÜùòÄ: Every campaign starts with a rock-solid strategy. It‚Äôs non-negotiable. Social media can be used at all levels of the funnel. We must translate the goals into relevant brand and media KPIS. üí∏ ùó£ùóÆùó∂ùó± ùó∂ùòÄùóª‚ÄôùòÅ ùóºùóΩùòÅùó∂ùóºùóªùóÆùóπ: Every social media campaign needs a solid paid media strategy, like it or not. üé∂ ùóõùó∂ùòÅ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóøùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅ ùóªùóºùòÅùó≤ùòÄ ùóºùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóøùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅ ùó∞ùóµùóÆùóªùóªùó≤ùóπùòÄ: Talk to your audience where they are, but make sure your messaging truly resonates. Plus, the greater the platform variation, the more sustainable the impact. üì£ ùóñùóøùó≤ùóÆùòÅùóºùóøùòÄ: When working with creators, give them direction, not chains. They know how to talk to their audience, and you‚Äôre killing their creative vision with too-rigid briefs. The best part? Each student team got the chance to apply all insights on a live case study, brainstorming and shaping their ideas for an actual campaign. It was impressive to see how diverse and creative the initial ideas were. Thank you to all the students for bringing the energy and to Chris Fotheringham for making it happen. See you next year! #SocialMediaWorkshop #JungvonMattSpree #JvMAcademy

What's Different at Duelly.com We are the Only company in the world focused on Challenge Marketing. Why Most Ads Fail ‚Äì And How Challenge Marketing Fixes It You all know it, you all do it. We‚Äôve all seen it happen: üö´ Pop-ups that get closed in milliseconds. üö´ Banner ads ignored like digital wallpaper. üö´ Video ads skipped at the first chance. Traditional advertising is broken because people don‚Äôt want to be interrupted, they want to be engaged. So, what if instead of forcing ads on people, your product became something they actively competed for? That‚Äôs where Challenge Marketing changes the game. ‚úîÔ∏è Engagement, Not Interruption ‚Äì People compete to win your product, creating deep emotional investment. ‚úîÔ∏è Genuine Interest ‚Äì Only those who care about your product participate, ensuring 100% relevant exposure. ‚úîÔ∏è Positive Brand Experience ‚Äì Instead of feeling "sold to," users feel rewarded for engaging with your brand. üí° Imagine this: Instead of a sneaker brand running another forgettable ad, they host a "Best Trick Challenge", where skaters showcase their skills to win a limited-edition pair. The audience judges, interacts, and competes for prizes too. Now, that‚Äôs engagement. If you‚Äôre ready to ditch ads that get skipped and start activating your audience, let‚Äôs talk. üì© DM me or drop a comment below, what product would YOU love to compete for?
