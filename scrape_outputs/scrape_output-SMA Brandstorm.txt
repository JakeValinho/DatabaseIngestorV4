𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿! See what we did there? We just grabbed your attention — precisely what a good social asset should do. Now that we’ve got you, let’s dive in! For the fourth year running, we’ve taken on the two-day Social Media workshop for the new class at JvM Academy in Hamburg - Raika Schmid (she/her), Jan Schmechtig (he/him), and Sascha Wieland had the best time with 19 bright students from all over Europe 🇪🇺 Here are a few golden rules they shared: 🤝 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿, 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿, 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿: Involve all relevant stakeholders. Strategy, Creatives, Social, Production, Media — it’s all about integration and cross-education. 🧠 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁, 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀: Every campaign starts with a rock-solid strategy. It’s non-negotiable. Social media can be used at all levels of the funnel. We must translate the goals into relevant brand and media KPIS. 💸 𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹: Every social media campaign needs a solid paid media strategy, like it or not. 🎶 𝗛𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹𝘀: Talk to your audience where they are, but make sure your messaging truly resonates. Plus, the greater the platform variation, the more sustainable the impact. 📣 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: When working with creators, give them direction, not chains. They know how to talk to their audience, and you’re killing their creative vision with too-rigid briefs. The best part? Each student team got the chance to apply all insights on a live case study, brainstorming and shaping their ideas for an actual campaign. It was impressive to see how diverse and creative the initial ideas were. Thank you to all the students for bringing the energy and to Chris Fotheringham for making it happen. See you next year! #SocialMediaWorkshop #JungvonMattSpree #JvMAcademy

What's Different at Duelly.com We are the Only company in the world focused on Challenge Marketing. Why Most Ads Fail – And How Challenge Marketing Fixes It You all know it, you all do it. We’ve all seen it happen: 🚫 Pop-ups that get closed in milliseconds. 🚫 Banner ads ignored like digital wallpaper. 🚫 Video ads skipped at the first chance. Traditional advertising is broken because people don’t want to be interrupted, they want to be engaged. So, what if instead of forcing ads on people, your product became something they actively competed for? That’s where Challenge Marketing changes the game. ✔️ Engagement, Not Interruption – People compete to win your product, creating deep emotional investment. ✔️ Genuine Interest – Only those who care about your product participate, ensuring 100% relevant exposure. ✔️ Positive Brand Experience – Instead of feeling "sold to," users feel rewarded for engaging with your brand. 💡 Imagine this: Instead of a sneaker brand running another forgettable ad, they host a "Best Trick Challenge", where skaters showcase their skills to win a limited-edition pair. The audience judges, interacts, and competes for prizes too. Now, that’s engagement. If you’re ready to ditch ads that get skipped and start activating your audience, let’s talk. 📩 DM me or drop a comment below, what product would YOU love to compete for?
