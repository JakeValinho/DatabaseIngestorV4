PEAK Case Competition
The PEAK Case Competition, presented by the SFU Beedie Student Engagement and Development Office, is designed specifically for case competitors who are looking for a more introductory case competition experience. Targeting primarily, students who are in their first to second year at SFU Beedie (less than 60 credits), and also upper year level transfer students with little to no case competition experience. PEAK will provide competitors with an opportunity to engage in a professional and structured case competition with like-minded peers to enhance and develop their own skills and abilities. This competition is a great stepping stone to the world of case competitions by providing a longer deliberation and relatively easier case.
PEAK is the perfect opportunity to see what competing is all about! We hope that participating in PEAK can help you explore your interest in case competitions. For those who have previously engaged in the Case Competition Training Program (CCTP), this is the perfect next step for you to continue applying your knowledge and to gain valuable practice in a structured case competition environment. Participated in the BUS 201/202 Case Challenge? This is a great opportunity for you to further your understanding and skill-set in the case competition arena, and to continue building connections with like-minded peers. Competed once or twice previously and looking to expand on your case competition experience? Look no further, we have you covered.
Competing students will work within teams to analyze a case and prepare their presentations to deliver to a panel of judges that include esteemed Faculty, Alumni, and industry professionals.
Registration is $5.00 CAD per competitor
and teams will have the opportunity to compete for real cash prizes:
1st place - $500 per competitor
2nd place - $200 per competitor
3rd place - $100 per competitor
If you're looking for a more advanced challenge, visit our
intermediate case competition, ELITE
.

The body of research on team dynamics is quickly expanding and it paints a clear picture -
diversity plays a key role in high-performing teams

Internal competitions
At SFU Beedie, we believe in the power of “learning by doing.” Our internal case competitions offer undergraduate students an opportunity to dive into the world of case analysis, problem-solving, and teamwork in close proximity to our campuses.
Why Participate?
Engaging in our own case competitions hones your analytical and communication skills and prepares you for the challenges of regional, national, and international competitions. Whether you’re a beginner eager to explore or an experienced competitor there is a tier of competition just for you.
What to Expect
Competitions, hosted by SFU Beedie and student organizations, create a dynamic environment where you can collaborate with peers, tackle real-world business challenges, and receive invaluable feedback from industry professionals.
Open to All
Many of our competitions are open to all SFU students and some open to those from across the Lower Mainland, fostering a diverse and enriching experience.
From business challenges to case competitions and hackathons, competitions are designed to test innovation, critical thinking, and teamwork. By participating, students tackle real-world problems, develop their professional acumen, and stand out in a competitive job market.
Internal Case Competitions
Case Challenge:
All students enrolled in BUS 201 or BUS 202 participate in a case competition as part of the course. Throughout the course, you will learn foundational skills to analyze a case and take it to the presentation stage. You will work in teams with your classmates, be judged by industry professionals, and receive feedback for your own growth.
PEAK Case Competition
:
PEAK is an introductory case competition experience designed primarily for students who are in their first to second year at SFU Beedie (fewer than 60 credits), and upper year level transfer students with little to no case competition experience. This competition is a stepping stone to the world of case competitions by allowing ample deliberation time. PEAK takes place every summer semester (June).
ELITE Case Competition
:
ELITE is a case competition experience for students with more than 60 credits completed, and ready to take on a bigger challenge. It is a three-day competition with an overnight component, inspired by international case competitions. Students deliberate on two cases in a short period of time and receive feedback from industry professionals whose companies are featured in the cases. ELITE takes place every summer semester (June-July).
Student organization competitions:
SFU Beedie is the proud sponsor of more than 12 business focused student organizations. Many offer case competitions, tailored to specific concentrations such as finance, human resources, entrepreneurship, etc.
Check out what student organizations are offering.
