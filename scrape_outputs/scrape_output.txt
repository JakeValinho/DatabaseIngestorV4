Thrilled to share that Tynen Wang , Alanna Agozzino, and I secured 3rd place nationally in the Canadian Tire Corporation's Ultimate Marketing Challenge! With over 50 teams competing across Canada, we were among the Top 5 invited to Canadian Tire’s headquarters to pitch our fully integrated marketing campaign for Party City's OBO Program. One of the most exciting moments? Hearing from Eva Salem about how she’s reshaping marketing at Canadian Tire. A huge thank you to our mentor Anna Beard (for your guidance in our preparation process) and the CT team: Amanda Volpato, Angelina Zhang, Tiffany Boughner, Helen Dang for hosting and sharing your expertise! I also want to thank the amazing mentors and judges I met: Jennifer (Jenna) D. Beales (for the kind words and insights), Sima Sadooghi (for the hair redo in my professional headshot), Jessie Ng (for sharing your experience with the EPM), Laura Relf (for your feedbacks on our presentation), and Brendon Peterson (for your insights on the budgeting aspect of marketing in CT). I am grateful for the opportunity to meet with the team. As I wrap up my case competition journey for this school year, I can confidently say that these experiences go far beyond aiming for the podium. I highly encourage students to seek out these opportunities—not just to compete, but to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what they’re capable of. #Marketing #CaseCompetition #CanadianTire #PartyCity #Learning #Growth #Leadership
