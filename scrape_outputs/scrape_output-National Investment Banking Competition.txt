Competition Overview
Founded in 2009, NIBC stands as a bridge between the academic and the professional world of investment banking. The Case Competition, which is hosted once a year, allows students to experience the rigors and rewards of a career in investment banking.
The Case Competition provides an authentic, first-hand view of the investment banking profession.
Competitors assume the roles of Investment Banking Analysts/Associates as they confront, devise, and present solutions to a real-world corporate finance scenario.
The Case Competition emphasizes a company within a particular sector, with past iterations highlighting Louis Vuitton (luxury fashion), Volkswagen Group (automotives), and Rockstar Entertainment (gaming).
The Case Competition occurs in two phases:Â the
First Round
and the
Final Round
.
First Round:
Competitors are introduced to the intricacies of investment banking from the viewpoint of an Investment Banking Analyst/Associate. Teams are given 4-6 weeks to construct a pitchbook outlining strategic recommendations for the provided company. Teams will also craft a precise valuation model consisting of Discounted Cashflows, Trading Comparables, and Precedent Transaction analyses.
To aid undergraduate and graduate students of all backgrounds, NIBCÂ Live provides pitchbook and model templates, as well as video and written guides on how to complete the case.
Submissions are graded by a team of investment banking professionals who kindly volunteer their time to NIBC. The top 50 teams are advanced to the FinalÂ Round, which is held in-person during the NIBCÂ Conference.
Final Round:
Set against the backdrop of Vancouver's premier 5-star waterfront venues, the Final Round delves deep into Transaction Advice, encompassing perspectives from the complete deal team.
Teams are provided with pre-constructed models, data sets, and a transaction memo tailored for in-depth strategic analysis. With an 8-hour timeframe, they refine this data into a persuasive boardroom presentation, where they present in front of real investment bankers.
The pinnacle of this round is the Gala Dinner, where finalist teams have the esteemed opportunity to showcase their insights and presentations to a distinguished judging panel of Managing Directors from the worldâs largest investment banks, as well as the broader conference crowd.
"NIBC isn't simply a competition; it's an odyssey into the heart of investment banking, an odyssey which molded me from a student to an empowered professional."

1) Develop Practical Skills
2) Connect with Employers
3) Gain Insights from Industry Leaders
4) Build Unique Experiences & Networks with International Peers
NIBC was founded with the vision of giving high-performing students an opportunity to measure their skills among top international recruiting talent and be recognized by employers.
Like any high-profile contest, NIBC strives to bring out the best in aspiring competitors who undergo rigorous training and preparation in order to succeed.
v. How do the cases enhance my classroom studies?
All case submission components represent deliverables investment banks produce for clients in the same quality and format. NIBC focuses on providing competitors with all of the resources, guidance and templates available at investment banks to help train competitors to produce client-ready work with efficient turn-around times.
The First Round requires each team to submit a valuation and strategic review of a company and industry, which coverage bankers would feel comfortable taking into the first meeting with a new client.
The Final Round places finalists in the position of a deal team one day before delivering a strategic recommendation to management and shareholders on a potentially game-changing transaction.
The scenarios competitors are tasked to analyze follow current market trends and companies without academic simplifications. Case deliverables are adjudicated by investment banking professionals relative to the standards expected in the industry.
For each NIBC case, professionals build a complete solution model and strategic review first before the model template and case package is created. Â  Â
vi. How can the competition help my investment banking career?
NIBC can provide you with the skills training, industry connections and avenues to demonstrate your skills to create career opportunities.est
vii. Which sponsors support the competition?
NIBC receives support from professionals and recruiters at international investment banks and private equity firms which help subsidize a portion of the competition. Please see the
Participating Firms
Â section below for more information.
viii. What can IÂ expect to learn in the FinalÂ Round?
The First Round allows competitor to develop the full skillset required from a summer intern or investment banking analyst.
â
Competitor Portal:
Once competitors sign up, they receive access to the competitor portal which provides video tutorials, best practices, research guides, financial models, slide templates and past cases to help competitors learn as efficiently as possible. These materials represent a collection of resources a new analyst would be given at a bank.
â
Case & Model Template:
The 100-page case package includes an in-depth explanation of what a client expects to see in a comprehensive corporate valuation and strategic review of their company.Investment banking professionals build a complete valuation model and summary analysis for the underlying company and industry for each case that is released.
While we wish every team the best of luck in making it to the Final Round, completion of the First Round case allows every competitor to acquire the skills to develop a complete valuation model and client-ready pitchbook. These skills and best practices are sure to make you a more effective professional in your investment banking career.
If your team does not advance, you will have the opportunity to attend the Final Round and work on the case simulation as conference participant (limited spots) and receive the same networking benefits.
ix. What skills will IÂ develop in the Final Round?
The Final Round offers the unique experience of working in a high-pressure live transaction environment. You will have a fully functional financial model and be required to analyze a transaction, create a pitchbook and present your recommendations to senior investment bankers in boardroom meetings, all while leading a team effort.
Leading up to the finals, finalist teams typically engage in many hours of honing their pitchbook creation, financial modeling as well as corporate finance skills, which has a lasting impact on the skill level of each competitor.
The Final Round also features keynote speakers, senior executives and investment banking and private equity professionals from several cities in North America including New York, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver to create a valuable networking environment for upcoming graduates.
Most notably, the high-caliber of competitors provides an unparalleled opportunity to build experiences and relationships with an international group of peers entering the investment banking industry all over the world.
x. I'm a second-year student, how can this competition help me?
The competition is designed to provide value for junior level students less familiar with investment banking. NIBC sets side up to 20% of Final Round spots for teams with primarily junior level studens and pairs them against teams with similar experience to give them a better chance of advancement.
NIBC also provides all of the training resources required to succeed in the competition through its training portal, which competitors have time to master as soon as they sign up.
xi. I'm a first-year student with limited knowledge of investment banking, will IÂ benefit?
The competition dates were chosen in consultation with recruiters to take place in Spring before early internship recruiting commences in the US (and Canada) to allow sponsors to scout out talent ahead of their regular internship & full-time recruiting cycles.
xii. I'm going into my final year and already secured a work placement, should IÂ participate?
One of the main goals of NIBC is to help competitors build a global network with high-achieving students and professionals, whether they have already secured a placement or are looking to go through the recruiting cycle. NIBC also provides access to notable buy side firms for students looking to recruit for the buy side.
xiii. Can IÂ form a team with students who are at different schools?
