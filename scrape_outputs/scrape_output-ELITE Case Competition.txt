ELITE Case Competition
The ELITE Case Competition, presented by SFU Beedie Student Engagement and Development Office, is designed specifically for case competitors looking for a challenging, competitive, and advanced case competition environment to further their growth and development.
Targeting primarily senior SFU students with previous case competition experience, ELITE will allow individuals to engage against other top-tier competitors at SFU and challenge themselves to enhance and refine their skills and abilities in a professional case competition environment.
Participating students will collaborate in teams to analyze a case and prepare their presentations for a panel of judges, including esteemed Faculty, Alumni, and industry professionals.
For Business students aspiring to represent SFU Beedie on the national/international stage, this is the ideal platform to showcase your talents, skills, and abilities to a panel of judges that include case coaches for many of our external SFU Beedie case competition teams.
Teams will have the opportunity to compete for real cash prizes and benefits from our industry case partner(s).
1st place - $500 per competitor
2nd place - $200 per competitor
3rd place - $100 per competitor
General Information
Date:
June 20 - 22, 2025
Location:
SFU Burnaby Campus
Registration:
Open until April 14, 2025 [11:59 p.m. PT]
Competition format: In-person
The competition will last three days and include two cases. Deliberation for both cases will occur during the competition weekend. Case presentations will take place on June 21 and 22. The final round of presentations will happen on June 22, followed by the awards ceremony.
Eligibility
Students must be at least 19 years old (at the time of the competition), enrolled at SFU in an undergraduate program, and in good academic standing.
Note:
Students who have represented SFU Beedie at a faculty-sponsored case competition, JDC West, and/or competed in a previous ELITE competition
are eligible
to compete, provided the team meets the team composition requirements below.
Team Composition
3 to 4 students that meet the eligibility requirements above
A
minimum
of 2 BBA students per team
A maximum of 2 students that have previously competed on the same team in any of faculty-sponsored case competitions, JDC West Academics or Debate, ELITE (non-finalist teams)
In the case of mixed pairings, each person must have only competed with a maximum of 1 other person on the team.
If you are unsure about the eligibility of your team composition, please reach out to the event organizer (contact information found at the bottom of the page)
Teams that are training for an
upcoming
competition (but have not yet gone to compete together) may compete in ELITE 2024, granted that the competition takes place after the ELITE 2024 registration deadline.
Special eligibility note:
Due to the significant change in the competition structure this year, competitors who have previously placed in ELITE finals are eligible to compete in ELITE 2024 as long as they compete with a completely new team – i.e. no teammates from previously placed (1st, 2nd or 3rd) teams can compete together. This registration is only valid for ELITE 2024 and will not apply to future ELITE Case Competitions.
We strongly encourage all competitors to carefully consider the question of diversity within the context of their teams. This can include diversity in gender, concentration(s), ethnicity, year level, education, previous work experiences, and other factors not listed here but may be relevant for you and your team members.
The body of research on team dynamics is quickly expanding, and it undoubtedly reveals
diversity plays a crucial role in high-performing teams
. Visit the
ELITE 2024 webpage
for additional team considerations.
Ideal Competitors
Have previously competed in PEAK, BUS 201/202 or have completed a significant number of BUS credits.
Have previously competed in advanced business case competitions (this can include JDC West, Faculty-sponsored external competitions such as CECC, ICC@M, LazICC, RSM STAR, BMCC, GBCC, etc., and previous ELITE case competitions) and are looking for a challenging and professional learning environment to refine and enhance their skill set.
Have a keen interest in competing at higher-level case competitions, including faculty-sponsored teams competing at international competitions.
Are looking to expand on their career competencies, including (but not limited to) items such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
Team Coaches
Each team may choose to have one team coach to help prepare them for the competition.
The coach is not to communicate with the team in any way related to the competition during the case deliberation period (as defined in the competition rules document).
There are no restrictions on who can coach (i.e. they may be a current student, alumni, or faculty member). The coach must sign a coaching agreement acknowledging these conditions before the start of the competition.
Registration is a commitment to participate.
Registration
As a team:
You can register as a team if you already have one formed. Each team member must submit an individual application and include all other teammates' names in their application. Note that each team must follow the team composition stated above.
As an individual:
You may register as an individual if you do not have a team. Individual registrants will be teamed up and notified of other team members after the registration period ends.

Undergraduate Case Competitions
Internal competitions
At SFU Beedie, we believe in the power of “learning by doing.” Our internal case competitions offer undergraduate students an opportunity to dive into the world of case analysis, problem-solving, and teamwork in close proximity to our campuses.
Why Participate?
Engaging in our own case competitions hones your analytical and communication skills and prepares you for the challenges of regional, national, and international competitions. Whether you’re a beginner eager to explore or an experienced competitor there is a tier of competition just for you.
What to Expect
Competitions, hosted by SFU Beedie and student organizations, create a dynamic environment where you can collaborate with peers, tackle real-world business challenges, and receive invaluable feedback from industry professionals.
Open to All
Many of our competitions are open to all SFU students and some open to those from across the Lower Mainland, fostering a diverse and enriching experience.
From business challenges to case competitions and hackathons, competitions are designed to test innovation, critical thinking, and teamwork. By participating, students tackle real-world problems, develop their professional acumen, and stand out in a competitive job market.
Internal Case Competitions
- Case Challenge: All students enrolled in BUS 201 or BUS 202 participate in a case competition as part of the course. Throughout the course, you will learn foundational skills to analyze a case and take it to the presentation stage. You will work in teams with your classmates, be judged by industry professionals, and receive feedback for your own growth.
- PEAK Case Competition: PEAK is an introductory case competition experience designed primarily for students who are in their first to second year at SFU Beedie (fewer than 60 credits), and upper year level transfer students with little to no case competition experience. This competition is a stepping stone to the world of case competitions by allowing ample deliberation time. PEAK takes place every summer semester (June).
- ELITE Case Competition: ELITE is a case competition experience for students with more than 60 credits completed, and ready to take on a bigger challenge. It is a three-day competition with an overnight component, inspired by international case competitions. Students deliberate on two cases in a short period of time and receive feedback from industry professionals whose companies are featured in the cases. ELITE takes place every summer semester (June-July).
- Student organization competitions: SFU Beedie is the proud sponsor of more than 12 business focused student organizations. Many offer case competitions, tailored to specific concentrations such as finance, human resources, entrepreneurship, etc.
Check out what student organizations are offering.
