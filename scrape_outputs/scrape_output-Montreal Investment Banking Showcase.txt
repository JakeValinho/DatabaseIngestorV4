Thanks to
CAIA Association
for booking this during one of my days in Toronto!

Looking forward to this panel on The Rise of GP Stakes Investing.  As many know, I was a Chapter Executive for Toronto from 2008-11 (when my new position at AIMA necessitated my passing the baton).  Head office in Amherst and I coordinated 10 events in 2010 (mostly at my fave
The Cambridge Club
).  

Anyways, this is a topic that has been in the news a fair bit but, like many alternatives, it's not ubiquitous (yet) and sharp investors can learn a great deal not only about this area but also techniques/frameworks that can be used in other situations as well.

CF&B Communication - Midcap Events

, working hand in hand for the benefit of the Small-and Mid-Cap Ecosystem. A belated and big BRAVO (again) to
Caroline Bader
for a hugely successful Paris event last week. Just like
INBOUND CAPITAL
,
CF&B Communication - Midcap Events
plays a critical role in the Small- and Mid-Cap Ecosystem to ensure the latter nurture a relevant investor audience with a stronger stock market valuation in mind. With its capacity to leverage its deep and proprietary investor database for optimal speed-dating,
CF&B Communication - Midcap Events
is highly complementary to
INBOUND CAPITAL
's Unique Selling Proposition (USP) which revolves around Equity Story Boosting, Forensic Investor Targeting and Investor Match-Making - among other benefits for Small- and Mid-Caps. After Paris, we look forward to more events together in other key financial centres in the UK and Europe!

I had the honor of hosting a round table on the CSRD at the CF&B conference in Paris this Wednesday. It sparked interesting discussions with representatives from Rubis, represented by its head of investor relations, Clémence Mignot Dupeyrot; Euronext, represented by its Chief Revenue Officer and IR leader, Nicolas Meunier; and Scope, represented by its President, Marc Lefèvre. The consensus was that despite the challenges, the CSRD presents a unique opportunity for Europe and compels companies to consider their future direction. In addition, it will be impossible to ignore, as it will ultimately impact companies' valuations. 
The topic is so broad that the time was insufficient to delve into all the issues related to implementing this new directive. But we did our best!

Now we have had the opportunity to review the transcript of this fascinating conversation, it seems apparent that thinking is turning hard to the nature of the inflection point we are reaching in global markets. In short, it is all well and good to talk about 'higher for longer' in the context of taking air out of a balloon that was pumped full of pandemic stimulus, but we have now reached the point where consumers everywhere are feeling the pain. And yet central banks may not cut, or at least not far, unless that pain metastasises into unemployment and other symptoms of spare capacity.
There are no easy answers for policymakers, especially as, at the same time, everyone is only too aware of the heightened atmosphere of political and geopolitical tension looming in H2. Talk on the RBNZ, for instance, coalesced around a sense that it may now be overdoing its hawkish tone.
The good news? Issuers have been able to make hay in H1, including in the Australian market - which has experienced unprecedented scale and consistency of demand. New Zealand has been harder for global borrowers but there is ongoing optimism about underlying demand even as pricing has been tough to line up.
You can read a full transcript of the discussion in the June/July edition of KangaNews magazine - to be published in late July.

Competition Overview
Founded in 2009, NIBC stands as a bridge between the academic and the professional world of investment banking. The Case Competition, which is hosted once a year, allows students to experience the rigors and rewards of a career in investment banking.
The Case Competition provides an authentic, first-hand view of the investment banking profession.
Competitors assume the roles of Investment Banking Analysts/Associates as they confront, devise, and present solutions to a real-world corporate finance scenario.
The Case Competition emphasizes a company within a particular sector, with past iterations highlighting Louis Vuitton (luxury fashion), Volkswagen Group (automotives), and Rockstar Entertainment (gaming).
The Case Competition occurs in two phases:Â the
First Round
and the
Final Round
.
First Round:
Competitors are introduced to the intricacies of investment banking from the viewpoint of an Investment Banking Analyst/Associate. Teams are given 4-6 weeks to construct a pitchbook outlining strategic recommendations for the provided company. Teams will also craft a precise valuation model consisting of Discounted Cashflows, Trading Comparables, and Precedent Transaction analyses.
To aid undergraduate and graduate students of all backgrounds, NIBCÂ Live provides pitchbook and model templates, as well as video and written guides on how to complete the case.
Submissions are graded by a team of investment banking professionals who kindly volunteer their time to NIBC. The top 50 teams are advanced to the FinalÂ Round, which is held in-person during the NIBCÂ Conference.
Final Round:
Set against the backdrop of Vancouver's premier 5-star waterfront venues, the Final Round delves deep into Transaction Advice, encompassing perspectives from the complete deal team.
Teams are provided with pre-constructed models, data sets, and a transaction memo tailored for in-depth strategic analysis. With an 8-hour timeframe, they refine this data into a persuasive boardroom presentation, where they present in front of real investment bankers.
The pinnacle of this round is the Gala Dinner, where finalist teams have the esteemed opportunity to showcase their insights and presentations to a distinguished judging panel of Managing Directors from the worldâs largest investment banks, as well as the broader conference crowd.
"NIBC isn't simply a competition; it's an odyssey into the heart of investment banking, an odyssey which molded me from a student to an empowered professional."

FAQ for NIBCÂ 2024-2025
For any question not answered below, or for further information, please email
info@nibcglobal.com
.
A. FAQ for Candidates Interested in Participating in NIBC
i. When does NIBCÂ 2024-2025 registration open?
Registration for NIBC 2024-2025 is open. Please review the
Competition Overview
and visit the
Competition Registration Page
. Additional details on registration requirements and competition schedule are summarized below or will be provided upon registration opening.
ii. Who can register and what are the requirements?
NIBC separates competitors into categories of undergraduate and graduate/MBA candidates. All members of one team must be registered as all undergraduate or all graduate students within the same university in either a full-time or part-time capacity at the time of registration (they may graduate while the competition is ongoing).
There is no cap per university and anyone can form a team without endorsement from the university.
Advancement is entirely merit-based and dependent on the relative quality of the submission. One or more teams may advance from each university.
If you have recently graduated within 3 years of the current calendar year-end, you may be eligible to compete in the Professionals & Recent Graduates category when it opens in the Fall.
Please note that students can participate in the first round by registering teams of 2-4 competitors. However, if a team of 2 advances to the final round they will need to add a 3rd and 4th team member.
iii. What is the competition timeline and process?
Please see the
Key Deadlines
section above for updated information. The First Round will take place online in the Fall/Winter of 2024 and the Final Round in the Spring of 2025.
Teams that submit a compliant submission in the First Round will be evaluated and the top teams will be selected to work on a live transaction scenario at the Final Round held this January in Vancouver, Canada.
iv. Why was NIBC created and what are its main goals?
The core goals of NIBC and professionals volunteering their time at the competition is to promote opportunities for aspiring business graduates to:
1) Develop Practical Skills
2) Connect with Employers
3) Gain Insights from Industry Leaders
4) Build Unique Experiences & Networks with International Peers
NIBC was founded with the vision of giving high-performing students an opportunity to measure their skills among top international recruiting talent and be recognized by employers.
Like any high-profile contest, NIBC strives to bring out the best in aspiring competitors who undergo rigorous training and preparation in order to succeed.
v. How do the cases enhance my classroom studies?
All case submission components represent deliverables investment banks produce for clients in the same quality and format. NIBC focuses on providing competitors with all of the resources, guidance and templates available at investment banks to help train competitors to produce client-ready work with efficient turn-around times.
The First Round requires each team to submit a valuation and strategic review of a company and industry, which coverage bankers would feel comfortable taking into the first meeting with a new client.
The Final Round places finalists in the position of a deal team one day before delivering a strategic recommendation to management and shareholders on a potentially game-changing transaction.
The scenarios competitors are tasked to analyze follow current market trends and companies without academic simplifications. Case deliverables are adjudicated by investment banking professionals relative to the standards expected in the industry.
For each NIBC case, professionals build a complete solution model and strategic review first before the model template and case package is created. Â  Â
vi. How can the competition help my investment banking career?
NIBC can provide you with the skills training, industry connections and avenues to demonstrate your skills to create career opportunities.est
vii. Which sponsors support the competition?
NIBC receives support from professionals and recruiters at international investment banks and private equity firms which help subsidize a portion of the competition. Please see the
Participating Firms
Â section below for more information.
viii. What can IÂ expect to learn in the FinalÂ Round?
The First Round allows competitor to develop the full skillset required from a summer intern or investment banking analyst.
â
Competitor Portal:
Once competitors sign up, they receive access to the competitor portal which provides video tutorials, best practices, research guides, financial models, slide templates and past cases to help competitors learn as efficiently as possible. These materials represent a collection of resources a new analyst would be given at a bank.
â
Case & Model Template:
The 100-page case package includes an in-depth explanation of what a client expects to see in a comprehensive corporate valuation and strategic review of their company.Investment banking professionals build a complete valuation model and summary analysis for the underlying company and industry for each case that is released.
While we wish every team the best of luck in making it to the Final Round, completion of the First Round case allows every competitor to acquire the skills to develop a complete valuation model and client-ready pitchbook. These skills and best practices are sure to make you a more effective professional in your investment banking career.
If your team does not advance, you will have the opportunity to attend the Final Round and work on the case simulation as conference participant (limited spots) and receive the same networking benefits.
ix. What skills will IÂ develop in the Final Round?
The Final Round offers the unique experience of working in a high-pressure live transaction environment. You will have a fully functional financial model and be required to analyze a transaction, create a pitchbook and present your recommendations to senior investment bankers in boardroom meetings, all while leading a team effort.
Leading up to the finals, finalist teams typically engage in many hours of honing their pitchbook creation, financial modeling as well as corporate finance skills, which has a lasting impact on the skill level of each competitor.
The Final Round also features keynote speakers, senior executives and investment banking and private equity professionals from several cities in North America including New York, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver to create a valuable networking environment for upcoming graduates.
Most notably, the high-caliber of competitors provides an unparalleled opportunity to build experiences and relationships with an international group of peers entering the investment banking industry all over the world.
x. I'm a second-year student, how can this competition help me?
The competition is designed to provide value for junior level students less familiar with investment banking. NIBC sets side up to 20% of Final Round spots for teams with primarily junior level studens and pairs them against teams with similar experience to give them a better chance of advancement.
NIBC also provides all of the training resources required to succeed in the competition through its training portal, which competitors have time to master as soon as they sign up.
xi. I'm a first-year student with limited knowledge of investment banking, will IÂ benefit?
The competition dates were chosen in consultation with recruiters to take place in Spring before early internship recruiting commences in the US (and Canada) to allow sponsors to scout out talent ahead of their regular internship & full-time recruiting cycles.
xii. I'm going into my final year and already secured a work placement, should IÂ participate?
One of the main goals of NIBC is to help competitors build a global network with high-achieving students and professionals, whether they have already secured a placement or are looking to go through the recruiting cycle. NIBC also provides access to notable buy side firms for students looking to recruit for the buy side.
xiii. Can IÂ form a team with students who are at different schools?
Unfortunately, team members must all be registered in either undergraduate or graduate studies at the same school at the time of registration.
xiv. My school is not listed asa participating school, can IÂ still register?
Yes! NIBC welcomes students from all recognised post-secondary educational institutes that are registered in undergradate or graduate programs at the time of registration.
xv. How can competitors prepare for the competition?
Upon registration, each competitor will receive access to training materials such as video tutorials, past examples and templates. To prepare for the cases, we specifically suggest polishing your practical excel and powerpoint skills and looking at past pitchbooks and financial models provided.
