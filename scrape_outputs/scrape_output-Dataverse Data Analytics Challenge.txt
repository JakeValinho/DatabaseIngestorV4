As you know, cooperation among cooperatives is one of the eight cooperative principles. Here at CUaxis, we believe in the power of cooperation and collaboration, which is why we created the CUaxis Referral Program. In case you haven't heard about this program, here's a rundown of it: Qualified Leads - For every qualified* credit union lead you submit to CUaxis, you will receive a $25 gift card. Demo - If one of those leads participates in a high-level overview demo of the CU*BASE core processing system, your credit union will receive an additional $25 gift card. Contract - If the credit union lead signs a contract with CUaxis, your credit union will receive a one-time $500 discount on your core processing monthly bill. And to reward your referral for signing a core contract with CUaxis, they'll receive a discount on their setup fees! So, what are you waiting for? Go out and tell one, tell all about the new CUaxis Referral Program! Then, submit your referrals here: https://hubs.li/Q02-P6540 #CUBASE #CoreProcessing #Core #CoreSystem #CUaxis #CollaborationAmongCooperatives #CollaborativeCommunity #CoreCommunity
