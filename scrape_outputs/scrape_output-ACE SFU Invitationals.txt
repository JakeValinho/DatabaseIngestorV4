On Sunday, March 30th, I had the pleasure of competing in ACE SFU's Invitationals competition. Partnering with Ryan C. Lee, we were able to achieve 1st place for the B2B category! I would attribute this win to my time at Axis Consulting, for helping me learn how to approach and structure difficult cases, and Simon Fraser University Debate Society for helping me with speech clarity/synthesis. Hopefully more successes to come! -Ryan
Excellent work Ryan!
Congratulations Ryan!
